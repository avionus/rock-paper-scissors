The readme for rock paper scissors made entirely in javascript! Are you looking for the readme I made for the google homepage? Well in my hubris I deleted it thinking it'd make loading/sharing my first project...a thing that could happen. It wasn't. It's gone now. No use crying over spiled milk. 

Anyway, I completed the first part of the project in about a day. I kinda cheated...I don't think we were supposed to use loops yet because we haven't exactly covered them but I couldn't figure out a way to get the game to play five times within one function without using loops. I kept getting only the last function called and it was...frustrating so I figured I'd work smarter not harder. Anyway, it's done and it works and honestly I'm feeling pretty good about it. 

The second part of the project was formulated to teach us about manipulating the DOM which I really enjoyed fiddling around with. More than anything, I'm learning that if I think something should be doable, I should try it and see if it works 'cause I may just be right. So I fiddled around with what I had from the previous project and now I have an up and running rock, paper, scissors (which I renamed, Sun, Moon, Planet) game! I encourage you to scope that html file; it's probably messier than a "real programmer's" html file, but I know it's already way better looking than my google mockup.
