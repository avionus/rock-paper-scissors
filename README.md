The readme for rock paper scissors made entirely in javascript! Are you looking for the readme I made for the google homepage? Well in my hubris I deleted it thinking it'd make loading/sharing my first project...a thing that could happen. It wasn't. It's gone now. No use crying over spiled milk. 

Anyway, I completed the project in about a day. I kinda cheated...I don't think we were supposed to use loops yet because we haven't exactly covered them but I couldn't figure out a way to get the game to play five times within one function without using loops. I kept getting only the last function called and it was...frustrating so I figured I'd work smarter not harder. Anyway, it's done and it works and honestly I'm feeling pretty good about it. I know we'll come back to it later, so I'm excited to put some browser functionality on it when the time comes!
